#DialedIn
This is a simple native Android app in order for me to learn Android Studio, Kotlin, and general practical coding.
Recently, I've been learning home espresso. While I have been making some progress pulling better shots, they are very inconsistent.
I am creating a logbook so that I can remember good and bad shots, dialing them in over time
Obviously, I could use a regular notes app, or write them on a piece of paper. That would be boring though.
This repo is a way to record the apps progress, as well as save me when I make a mistake so bad that the whole thing won't run. I love version control
